## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder 1

**Name:** Jamie K.  
**Profile:** A 27-year-old marketing professional who is committed to self-improvement but struggles to maintain consistent habits due to a hectic schedule.

**Interview Summary:**  
Jamie finds it challenging to remember daily healthy practices (e.g., staying hydrated, exercising, practicing mindfulness) amidst work and personal commitments. While Jamie has experimented with various habit-tracking apps, they found that many are either overly complex or require cumbersome account setups. Jamie expressed a desire for an app that is quick to use, visually motivating, and adaptable to life’s interruptions.

**Goals/Needs:**
- **Quick Habit Creation:** Easily add new habits with minimal steps.
- **Timely Reminders:** Receive local notifications that prompt habit completion at the right time.
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** Monitor daily and weekly progress via streak counts, calendars, or simple graphs.
- **Flexible Management:** Ability to pause or adjust habits without losing progress or feeling discouraged.
- **Optional Social Accountability:** Share selected habit progress with friends to boost motivation.

**Problems/Frustrations:**
- **Forgetfulness:** Regularly misses daily habits due to a busy schedule.
- **Overly Complex Interfaces:** Current apps have too many features, making it difficult to quickly log or view progress.
- **Lack of Immediate Feedback:** Insufficient visual cues (like streaks or progress graphs) to motivate continuous improvement.
- **Inflexibility with Life Events:** Existing apps don’t allow for easy pausing of habits during exceptional circumstances (e.g., travel, illness), which can disrupt motivation.



### Stakeholder 2

**Name:** Alex M.  
**Profile:** A 20-year-old college student juggling academic responsibilities, a part-time job, and a busy social life. Alex is eager to establish a balanced routine that includes studying, exercise, and self-care, but finds it difficult to integrate habit tracking into an already overloaded schedule.

**Interview Summary:**  
Alex expressed that while multiple digital tools help manage academic schedules and assignments, none effectively address personal habit tracking. Alex needs a dedicated, streamlined tool that complements a busy lifestyle without adding complexity. A user-friendly interface with quick logging, flexible scheduling adjustments, and visually appealing progress tracking would make a significant difference. Additionally, the ability to pause habits during periods of high academic pressure or unexpected events was highlighted as essential.

**Goals/Needs:**
- **Integrated Scheduling:** Seamlessly manage and integrate personal habits alongside academic and work schedules.
- **Simplified Logging:** Quickly log habit progress without navigating through multiple screens or settings.
- **Motivation Through Visual Feedback:** Use streaks, calendars, or simple graphs to monitor progress and stay motivated.
- **Flexibility:** Easily adjust or pause habits during exam periods, project deadlines, or personal events.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive design that minimizes distractions and streamlines the habit tracking process.

**Problems/Frustrations:**
- **Digital Overload:** Too many apps already clutter Alex’s digital life; adding a complex habit tracker is not appealing.
- **Rigid Scheduling:** Existing habit trackers often do not offer enough flexibility to accommodate a fluctuating college schedule.
- **Poor User Experience:** Cluttered interfaces and excessive features in current apps make habit logging a chore rather than a help.
- **Inconvenient Reminders:** Notifications that come at inopportune times or are easily missed disrupt rather than support daily routines.

## Product Vision Statement

**HabitMinder** is a simple, privacy-focused Habit Tracker & Reminder app that empowers busy individuals to effortlessly build and maintain positive routines through intuitive habit creation, timely local notifications, and visual progress tracking.
